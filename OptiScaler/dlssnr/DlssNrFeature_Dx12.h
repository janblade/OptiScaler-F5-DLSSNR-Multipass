// DLSS 5 Neural Rendering, run over the upscaler's output.
//
// Neural Rendering is a post-process, not an upscaler and not a denoiser: it takes a finished frame plus
// depth and motion vectors and synthesises detail. NVIDIA ships no public integration for it, so it is
// driven directly through nvngx_dlssnr.dll as feature 18.
//
// OptiScaler is the right host for it because of one thing it knows that an external hook cannot: which
// NGX evaluate belongs to the upscaler and which to frame generation. Both are handed depth and motion
// vectors, so anything guessing from the parameter block alone attaches to both and runs the model twice
// per rendered frame. Here it is a lookup on the feature handle.

// Called only for upscaler evaluates -- never for frame generation, which is the whole point.

// Safe to call every frame; it builds what it needs on first use and disables itself for the session if
// anything fails, rather than retrying into a crash.
