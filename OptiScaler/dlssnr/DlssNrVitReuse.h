// Reuse of the ViT bottleneck of NVIDIA's own DLSS-NR model.
//
// One NR evaluation launches its kernels on the game's command list: through NvAPI on D3D12, through
// VK_NVX_binary_import's vkCmdCuLaunchKernelNVX on Vulkan (one launch per call, see Filter::One). The ViT bottleneck
// (blocks 31-38, the coarsest and most stable level of the network) is one contiguous run of those launches, from
// cc_vit_1d_repack_2d_to_1d through cc_vit_1d_repack_1d_to_2d, and about a fifth of the evaluation. Leaving that run
// out on some frames leaves the previous frame's result in its output buffer, which the next kernel reads (on the plain
// set: in its 1-D result, see below).
//
// Why dropping the run is safe (checked on a real capture, fp8 kernels): the run's sync counters are referenced by no kernel outside
// it, so nothing that is kept can wait on something that was dropped; and its output buffer is written only by its last kernel.
// Anything that does not look like that turns the feature off for the session instead of guessing.
// The caller records a UAV barrier where a skipped run ends (before its kept last kernel on the plain set, see below), so the kernels
// on either side of the gap cannot overlap on the GPU.
//
// The plain fp16 kernels (used by some modified DLSS-NR DLLs) lay the network's memory out differently: the run's 2-D output, which the
// decoder reads, shares memory with an early full-size activation that is rewritten every evaluation. Only the run's 1-D result, the
// input of its last kernel (repack_1d_to_2d), keeps its own memory. So on that set a skipped run keeps its last kernel, which rebuilds
// the 2-D output from the kept 1-D result. That kernel takes only its source, its destination and two sizes (checked on a plain
// capture): it waits on no sync counter, so it can run without the rest of the run. The fp8 set drops it: there the 2-D output keeps its
// own memory, and nothing says the 1-D result does.
//
// This header is only the decision: which launch of an evaluation is dropped. It knows nothing about NvAPI, so tests/nr_vit_reuse_smoke.cpp
// exercises it on the host.
