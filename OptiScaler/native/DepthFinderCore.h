// The API-neutral half of the depth finder: the counting, the pick, the warm-up and the stand-down, for the native input
// producer (DLSS-NR in a game that makes no upscaler call). It knows nothing of Direct3D: an adapter for a game API (today
// resource_tracking/GenericDepth_Dx12.cpp; D3D11, D3D10 and D3D9 later) hooks its API, turns what it sees into the events below
// (plain numbers, no API types), and does the physical copies of the picked depth that this class asks for. See
// docs/NATIVE-INPUT-ADAPTERS.md for what an adapter must do.
//
// The rules (vertices weighed over draw calls, the viewport and workload tests on clears, the best stretch to copy, the
// reversed-Z hint from the clear value) are adapted from ReShade's Generic Depth add-on, Copyright (C) 2021 Patrick Mours,
// BSD-3-Clause; see Licenses/ReShade_GenericDepth_LICENSE.txt. The heuristic itself is in GenericDepth_Select.h.
//
// Contexts: a "context" is whatever records draws in order and can bind one depth buffer at a time: a D3D12 command list, or
// the immediate context of D3D11, D3D10 and D3D9 (one context for the whole game). The adapter identifies it with a number.
//
// Threads: every event may come from any game thread; the class locks inside. The adapter must not call it while holding a
// lock that a snapshot copy also takes. The three per-draw events (OnDraw, OnIndirect, OnViewport) take no lock: each context
// keeps its own running counts, which only the thread recording that context writes, and the other events fold them into the
// shared counts of the buffer it is bound to. A context is recorded by one thread at a time, as D3D12 requires of a command list.
