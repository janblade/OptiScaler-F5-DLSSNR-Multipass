// The native input producer's motion step, in a live game (Story 2 of the epic): while the game makes no upscaler call, the
// finished picture is run through OpticalFlowDx12 once per presented frame, on a command list of our own on the swap chain's
// queue, and the flow can be looked at in the DLSS-NR menu. Nothing is changed in the game's picture or lists.
//
// Switched on with [DlssNr] NativeMotion (the menu checkbox applies at once). It waits while the game calls an upscaler, the
// same condition the depth finder stands down for (and runs from the start when the finder is not installed).

// from what an upscaler call captured this frame) and before the menu is drawn. `queue` is the swap chain's queue. Does
// nothing while OnFGPresent is being called.
