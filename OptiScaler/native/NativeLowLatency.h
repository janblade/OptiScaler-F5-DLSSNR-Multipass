// Optical F5Low's low latency: OptiScaler calls the Reflex API itself, because a game that makes no upscaler call makes
// no Reflex call either, and XeFG's XeLL needs those calls in any game that does not make them. One path for every vendor: through ReflexHooks' function table, so real Reflex on NVIDIA and
// fakenvapi (Anti-Lag 2, XeLL or LatencyFlex, whichever the fakenvapi settings pick) everywhere else. D3D11 and D3D12
// go through the D3D-flavoured NVAPI entry points (NvAPI_D3D_*); a native Vulkan game goes through the Vulkan-flavoured
// ones (NvAPI_Vulkan_*, OnPresentBeginVulkan/OnPresentEndVulkan below) -- different device handle, different call
// surface, but the same decision and pacing underneath.
//
// The calls are paced by the game's Present, since there are no engine hooks:
//   after Present returns: PRESENT_END, Sleep, SIMULATION_START
//   the frame's first queue submit (D3D12) / first draw (D3D11) / nothing earlier on Vulkan: SIMULATION_END,
//   RENDERSUBMIT_START
//   just before Present: RENDERSUBMIT_END, PRESENT_START
// The markers are approximate, so useMarkersToOptimize stays off. It runs only while native/NativeLowLatencyRule.h
// says so (an Optical F5Low mode or XeFG runs, the game makes no Reflex call itself, fakenvapi's Force Reflex and Force
// XeLL are not in the way) and stands aside the moment the game calls Reflex. Our own calls are not counted as the game's.
// Never writes a fakenvapi setting.
