// When Optical F5Low's virtual upscaler (native/VirtualUpscalerDriver.h) is let go, paused or rebuilt. Pure, so a host
// test can run it (tests/nr_virtual_upscaler_hold_smoke.cpp).
//
// Letting it go destroys frame generation's context with it, and making both again costs hundreds of milliseconds on
// the present thread plus a gap in frame generation. A game that calls its own upscaler only for a moment (menus,
// cutscenes, a loading screen) therefore only pauses it; it is let go once the game's calls have run for kTakeoverMs.
// And the backend is rebuilt at once for a new size, format or backend, but for a flip of the depth direction or HDR
// (the depth finder's pick can change between candidates) only once the flip has held for kKeySettleFrames frames.
