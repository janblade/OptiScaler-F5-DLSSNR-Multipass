// The Vulkan adapter's frame source: the game's swapchain image is copied into a texture shared with a private D3D12
// device (native/SharedFrameVk.h), the producer works on it there, and the result is copied back before the present.
// Everything is ordered on the GPU through one D3D12 fence opened as a Vulkan timeline semaphore:
//
//   Acquire, on the present's queue:  wait for the present's semaphores -> copy in -> signal N
//   the producer, on the D3D12 queue: wait N -> optical flow, trust mask, DLSS-NR -> (Return) signal N+1
//   Return, on the present's queue:   wait N+1 -> copy back -> signal the semaphore the present now waits on
//
// So the present waits for NR on the GPU, and the CPU waits for nothing (the command ring's slots are a few frames old
// when reused). When the producer gives no result, Return still hands the present a semaphore, signalled after the copy
// in; the picture is then the game's own.
//
// The hooks (hooks/Vulkan_Hooks.cpp) tell it about the devices' queues and the swapchains, since Vulkan cannot be asked
// afterwards which family a queue is of or what a swapchain's images are.
