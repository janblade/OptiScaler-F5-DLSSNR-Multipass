// The Automatic exposure Trim every game gets while the user has not set one (ini AutoExposureTrim = auto), and
// whether it follows the game's own exposure by default.
//
// The Trim default is one value for every game, +1.5 EV on the menu's scale (user decision 2026-09-26, for simplicity).
// Measured before (FrameStats, model-input median): RDR2 0.48 at +2.3 EV and 0.77-0.80 at +4.3 EV; NBA 2K27 0.41 at
// +2.3 EV and yellow highlights in its player shadows at +4.3 EV. The slider sets any game's own value.
//
// Following the game's exposure is right only for a game that hands over its frame before applying its own exposure
// (unexposed: RDR2's raw scene luminance, the game's exposure of ~0.006-0.013 comes later); for the usual pre-exposed
// frame (NBA 2K27, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3) it would apply the game's exposure a second time. Which kind a game is
// cannot be read off the frame: a dark unexposed scene has the numbers of a pre-exposed one (RDR2 read 12-116 in dim
// scenes on 2026-09-26, 900-1700 in daylight), and the DLSS inputs are the same (NBA passes an exposure texture,
// PreExposure 1 and the flag like RDR2). So the games measured to be unexposed are listed by exe and follow by default;
// the user's Follow checkbox overrides it both ways.
//
// Header-only and free of D3D/Vulkan types so it can be exercised on the host (tests/nr_auto_trim_smoke.cpp).
