// The composition pass for Neural Rendering.
//
// Neural Rendering is two things, and only one of them is a shader. The model is an NGX feature --
// created and evaluated, not dispatched -- and that stays where it is. This is the other half: the
// pass that builds the tone-mapped proxy the model is shown, and then transfers the model's answer
// back onto the real frame.
//
// It is an ordinary compute shader with a constant struct, so it belongs here alongside RCAS and
// Output Scaling rather than owning a bespoke root signature and descriptor ring of its own.
//
// One shader, three modes, because all three read and write the same set of resources and differ
// only in what they compute:
//
//   Encode   the frame -> a tone-mapped proxy, plus an untouched copy to transfer against later
//   Down     the proxy -> a smaller proxy, when the model is asked to work below full resolution
//   Resolve  proxy + model answer + untouched copy -> the frame, edited

// Three dispatches are recorded per frame and several frames can be in flight at once, more so with
// frame generation. Each dispatch needs descriptors and constants the GPU is not still reading, so
// there has to be enough for three passes times the deepest pipeline we might sit behind.
// Descriptor and constant slots, consumed one per dispatch and reused round-robin with no fence.
//
// A frame records the meter, its reduce, eye adaptation, the exposure courier, encode, downsample, one clamp per
// extra model pass, resolve and, during a Tune run, the stats pass: about ten with the default passes. The model
// layers themselves are NGX evaluates and do not consume this ring; their A/B resources and feature histories are
// persistent. Reuse detail between frames (DlssNr_DetailReuse.inl) adds up to four more on a full frame (compose,
// estimate, steady, capture) and four on a reused one (estimate, fill, save motion, capture), which skips the clamps.
// Sixty-four slots leave four or more such frames before descriptor/constant reuse; many more passes leave fewer.
