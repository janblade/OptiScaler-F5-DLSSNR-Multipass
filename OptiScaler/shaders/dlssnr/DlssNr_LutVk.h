// The LUT-apply epic's grade pass on Vulkan (precompile/dlssnr_lut.hlsl, SPIR-V).
//
// Self-contained rather than a mode of DlssNr_Vk: that class has a fixed seven-binding layout built around
// dlssnr.hlsl, and this shader is the first of the family to sample a 3D texture. Its own five bindings (constants,
// source, LUT, sampler, target), its own pipeline and its own rings keep every other pass's layout untouched, as the
// D3D12 side does with its own root signature.
//
// Nothing here exists until a LutFile is set: the owner constructs this lazily, and the pipeline itself is only built
// on the first dispatch. A failure to build is logged once and never retried; the owner then goes on ungraded.
//
// Lifetime. The 3D image and the constants/descriptor rings are read by frames still in flight. A slot is never
// rewritten within kFramesInFlight frames of its last use, and the 3D image (and the staging buffer its upload read
// from) is only replaced or freed through ReleaseLutImage/Destroy, which the owner calls after vkDeviceWaitIdle.
